So I know my thoughts on this are just a puff in the wind, but I stepped away from Twitter yesterday.

It's not that I haven't seen value in being there these last 10 years - in fact, I made and maintained quite a few friendships through the site. 

However, the tone and temper of Twitter has changed over the years. It came to a head yesterday and I no longer feel it's a safe place, nor do I want to support those who operate it.

A small gesture, but a meaningful one that feels right to me, and that's what matters.

I'm attempting to give [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/web/@jonnyborbs) a try, but despite being a pretty good platform and overall _technical_ experience, it still very much lacks the critical user mass that a network needs to survive. Maybe this is the year that changes. Maybe not. 

See you out there.
