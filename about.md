Hi there, I'm Jon. I go by  he/him and I'm a product manager focused on SaaS devops tools. Right now I work at [LaunchDarkly](https://www.launchdarkly.com), but I've previously been at [HashiCorp](https://www.hashicorp.com) focused on Terraform Cloud, and [VMware](https://www.vmware.com) where I helped launch vRealize Automation Cloud.

I live in the Sacramento, California area with my partner and many rescue parrots.

I've also linked my other two blogs in the sidebar, including [8BITDMC](https://www.8bitdmc.com) where I keep the records of my work restoring and enjoying my 1981 DeLorean, and [vAficionado](https://www.vaficionado.com) which is my legacy tech blog mainly focused on VMware automation solutions.

To learn more about my current work, check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/jonnyborbs), my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jon-schulman), or my [Polywork](https://www.polywork.com/jschulman)
